===============================
Ceph Charms Layering
===============================

The Ceph charms need to shed technical debt to allow faster iteration.

Problem Description
===================

There is lots of duplicate code in the ceph, ceph-mon, ceph-osd and ceph-radosgw
charms.  The aim is to eliminate most of that using the new Juju layers approach.

Proposed Change
===============

The new layering/reactive way of charming offers the Ceph charms significant
benefits.  Between ceph-mon, ceph-osd, ceph and ceph-radosgw we have a lot of
duplicate code.  Some of this code has been pulled out and put into the charmhelpers
library but that can't be done for everything.  The juju layering approach to charms
will allow the rest of the shared code to be consolidated down into a base layer.

Here is where you cover the change you propose to make in detail. How do you
propose to solve this problem?

If this is one part of a larger effort make it clear where this piece ends. In
other words, what's the scope of this effort?

Gerrit Topic

    git-review -t layering

Work Items
----------
1. Create a ceph base layer.  These is the biggest piece of the project.  All
duplicate code that is shared between ceph ceph-mon and ceph-osd will be consolidated
down into this base layer.
  - Copy over unit tests
2. Create a ceph-mon layer that utilizes the ceph base layer.  Once the base layer
is settled the next step will be to build the ceph-mon charm on top of the base
layer.
  - Copy over unit tests
3. Create a ceph-osd layer that utilizes the ceph base layer
  - Copy over unit tests
4. Recreate the ceph charm by combining the ceph-osd + ceph-mon layers.  With layering
the ceph charm essentially becomes just a combination of the other layers.  We get this
almost for free and it should be easy to maintain all 3 charms going forward.
  - Copy over unit tests

Repositories
------------

Will any new git repositories need to be created?  Yes there will initially be
new repos created however these will migrate to the OpenStack repo.

3. https://github.com/ChrisMacNaughton/juju-interface-ceph-radosgw
4. https://github.com/ChrisMacNaughton/juju-interface-ceph-osd
5. https://github.com/ChrisMacNaughton/juju-layer-ceph-mon
6. https://github.com/ChrisMacNaughton/juju-layer-ceph-osd

Documentation
-------------

There shouldn't be any documentation changes needed for this.  The aim to have
identical functionality to what was there before.

This will impact developer workflow because at some point we're going to have to
stop all posts to all the repos and cut over to this new version of the charm.
The repositories are also going to change. The goal is to publish them layered
version of the charm rather than the compiled bits. The test automation will
then compile the layered charm and use that for testing instead of just
cloning the repo like it does today.

Security
--------

No additional security concerns.


Testing
-------

Because this is such a radical change from what we had
before the only way to accurately test it is to show identical functionality
to what we had before. A mojo spec will be used to demonstrate this.
